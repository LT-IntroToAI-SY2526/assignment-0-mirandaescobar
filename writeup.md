## Looking Ahead

**What aspect of AI are you most excited to learn about this year? Explain why.**

The aspect of AI that I am most excited to learn about is how it works from the barebones. I think it's important to learn about this because I have seen AI quickly move into all aspects of life. For example, I remember when AI was implemented with Siri, Alexa, and google and people were very cautious with it. While as now more than 10 years later, the way people interact is completely different. I think it will be a resourceful tool to learn more about how AI operates and how useful it can be in the future. I also look forward to learning more about conservation of art when it comes to AI along with copywrite usuage. I am interested in learning more about that because most recently it has made it even easier to create images, and even going around social media as simple trends. Yet, I know this may seek risk to graphic designers who are reliant on there craft.
